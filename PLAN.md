# Step 1

- Remove default Vite JS and CSS from app.jsx and app.css. ✅
- APPROACH: start with a single component to get something working in app.js. Then maybe split out a few bits to create a Header and Footer component.
- Adding to above, create a simple test component in.
- Eventually, we want end up with a component tree that looks like this:

App
├── Header 
├── Form
├── Flashcards
│ └── Flashcard
└── Footer

- 🚨 TIP: A final piece of advice would be: The Header, Footer, Flashcards and Flashcard are the easier bits. Do them first 🙂.

- Create a very simple Header -(❌)component- (just with an H1 title in it).✅
- Repeat for the Flashcards and Footer components. 
- Test that all component display properly in the browser before continuing.
- Create individual Flashcard components and hard code some "flashCards" data in the App component to begin with.

# Step 2

- Once those components are done, then move on to create a Form component.

# Step 3
